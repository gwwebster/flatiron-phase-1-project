## Simple S&P 500 Index Investment Estimator

## Description
This is a basic program for estimating long-term returns on five popular S&P 500 index fund investments(1). The program assumes an annual growth rate of about 11.60%, which is the historical average over the past 40 years(2). The growth in value of the investment compounds annually, as the program assumes that the investment remains in the fund for the duration of the term length. The program also adjusts this annual growth rate down to 8% to (conservatively) compensate for inflation(2). The calculations also factor in applicable minimum investments and expense ratios for each fund. Note that this program is based on historical averages and not intended to function as investment advice -- your mileage may vary.

## Usage
To run the program, simply select one of the index funds from the dropdown menu, then enter an initial investment amount and a term length in years. Clicking the "Estimate" button calculates the estimated (real) value of your investment at the end of the term length. Each estimated return value appear in the search log, along with additional information on each investment. Hovering over each search result highlights the estimated return value. The program also has a light/dark mode functionality.
